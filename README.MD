## Commit conventions
As a team, we've agreed to make use of commit conventions in order to keep track of what we've accomplished with ease as well as to communicate this at a simple glance. Commit messages start with their code, begin with a capital letter and are written in imperative language ('gebiedende wijs' in Dutch).

CODES:
	a	INIT - Initial commit / changes;
	b	ADD - A change in the file structure, like (re)moving files or adding them;
	c	FEAT - A new feature added to the app;
	d	STYLE - Styling the app;
	e	README - Documentation;
	f	COM - Comments for clarification
